  Mid-Autumn Festival is one of the most important festival in China, It happens to be August 15th of our Chinese lunar. 



  It is typical of each Chinese to celebrate the festival. Usually, no matter how how far away or how busy we are. We have to try to come home to celebrate with our families.



  When the moon up in the sky, we sit together and eat mooncakes and some fruit, sharing our own stories. Sharing stories with our families is the one of the happiest things for every Chinese person.
